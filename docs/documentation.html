              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>
                "Cervelli in Fuga" is a project on young Italian people and
                their choice of leaving their home country. Often discussed in
                the media, the problem of emigration in Italy has various
                factors that need to be taken into account in order to
                understand what really lies behind the big number of young
                people choosing to live and work abroad.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="item-1-1">
              <h5>Scenario</h5>
              <p>
                This project aims to investigate what might be the possible
                reasons behind many young people's choice of leaving Italy. Our
                hypothesis is that the difficulty in gaining a proper economic
                indipendence and the lack of meritocracy are the main aspects
                that bring young Italians to leave their home country. In order
                to consider this hypothesis on the level of data, we have
                considered 16 datasets related to graduate rate employment,
                house prices, hourly wage and work satisfaction. The time span
                taken into account for this analysis goes from 2014 to 2022, as
                our aim is to give a full picture of young Italians' working
                conditions in the most recent years. Of course, this project
                does not aim to draw any conclusions on the matter: in fact,
                data is not enough to tell the full story and the fact that
                these aspects might or might not be correlated does not imply
                that anything in terms of causality. Moreover, the team of this
                project selected the datasets on the basis of the hypothesis
                previously stated: therefore, the choice of the datasets is not
                scientifically grounded. Within the sphere of interest, datasets
                were selected on the basis of availability and compatibility
                with one another. All these factors considered, it is once again
                necessary to state that this project is the elaboration of an
                hypothesis and does not aim to make any type of statements.
                Further research is needed in order to assess a conclusion, and
                more datasets need to be taken into account to cross-check the
                results.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>ISTAT </b>is the primary source of statistics in Italy,
                  regarding population, wages, environmental issues, social
                  problems, all gathered through surveys and analyses. Here,
                  focusing on young people and the reason why they emigrate, we
                  decided to analyze quite a number of datasets coming from this
                  source, exploring hourly wages, price of houses, percentage of
                  young people still living with their parents, work
                  satisfaction and percentage of young italians that have
                  emigrated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>ALMALAUREA</b> is a consortium joined by 75 Italian
                  universities and the Ministry of Education, Universities and
                  Research, with the purpose or objectives of statistical
                  studies related to the Italian university world. This source
                  has been used to extract information about the rate of
                  employed graduates in Italy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The datasets obtained from Istat have already been filtered at
                the source, considering common and necessary variables to be
                displayed within the datasets. On the other hand, for datasets
                obtained from AlmaLaurea, it was not possible to filter the
                necessary data at the source, so it was necessary to download
                the entire CSV files, provided year by year. Subsequently,
                especially for the latter, a cleaning process was carried out to
                select only the necessary data and merge the data together.

                accuracy of the provided data and, above all, its suitability
                for the intended use." These four characteristics are:

              <h5>Legal</h5>
              <p>
                Before reasling datasets to the public, it is necessary to
                investigate the legal framework that allows or resctrits its
                publication.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following check list is an instrument to verify the legal
                aspects connected to the publication of data. Basing ourselves
                on this checklsit, for each dataset we evaluated the following
                topics: privacy issues, IPR policy, licenses, limitations on
                public access, economical conditions, and temporal aspects of
                the dataset.
              </p>

              </ul>
              <p>
                We performed the legal analyis directly on the platforms that
                initially hosted the datasets, in order to have a full picture
                of the legal status of these data. Therefore, all datasets
                analysed are not owned by the creators of this project. However,
                the datasets used for the visualizations are a result of the
                mesh-up between different datasets and they are owned by
                "Cervelli in Fuga". Therefore, all datasets processed and
                created during the mesh-up phase are updated to January 2024.
                For complete and precise information, however, the user is
                invited to refer to the origianal datasets linked in the section
                related to the Quality Analysis.

              <h6>Format</h6>
              <p>
                The data from Istat is made available in various versions for
                download, such as CSV, JSON, Excel, and SDMX-CSV. The latter is
                an open standard format as it has a formal specification (XML).
                The other formats are not open standards, but CSV, in
                particular, is a format used for the exchange of tabular data.
                Data from AlmaLaurea is available for download only in CSV
                format.

                The "National Guidelines for Enhancing Public Information
                Heritage", in particular considering the section related to

                  href="https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/stabile/modellometadati.html"
                  >Metadata Model</a
                >, highlight four distinct levels of metadata that progressively
                convey the degree of connection between data and metadata, along
                with the level of detail. <br />
                The metadata from Istat has a dual description that places them
                at both level 4 and level 2. Level 2 represents a weak bond
                between data and metadata and it is represented by external
                metadata accessible from the SIqual portal (cases where this
                information can be accessed are reported in the "timeliness"
                section of the "quality analysis" table). Level 4 is represented
                by the data contained in SDMX format files that link metadata to
                each individual data point. This combination allows for metadata
                that is comprehensible both to humans and machines. Datasets
                from AlmaLaurea do not include metadata, so they fall into level
                1.
              </p>
              <h6>Licenses</h6>
              <p>
                During the preliminary technical analysis, the licenses used
                within the original datasets are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Regarding ISTAT data, they are made available under the
                  CC-BY-3.0 license, as indicated
                  <a href="https://www.istat.it/it/note-legali">here</a>. This
                  license allows for "reproduction, distribution, transmission,
                  and adaptation of data and analyses from the National
                  Institute of Statistics, even for commercial purposes,
                  provided that the source is cited."
                </li>

                <li>
                  On the other hand, in the case of AlmaLaurea, there is no
                  explicit reference on the type license used, with the only
                  indication being "Unless otherwise indicated, reproduction for
                  non-commercial purposes with citation of the source is
                  authorized".

              </ul>
              <p>
                Considering the two different licenses used for the original
                datasets, we had to find a commmon ground when choosing the
                license for publishing the mash-up datasets. Datasets I2, I3, I5

                    computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for

              <h4>Mash up</h4>
              <p>
                The dataset mash-up was carried out in two phases: the creation
                of intermediate datasets and then the creation of the final
                mashed datasets.
              </p>
              <h6>Intermediate datasets.</h6>
              <p>
                The creation of intermediate datasets was necessary to
                facilitate the subsequent combination of datasets, particularly
                considering the initial data from AlmaLaurea. As mentioned
                earlier, it was necessary to download the datasets in their
                entirety from the source, as filtering was not possible.
                Additionally, the CSV file was not formatted correctly,
                requiring a cleaning process where only a specific row of the
                dataset related to the employment of individuals 3 years after
                obtaining a master's degree. In this case, the intermediate
                dataset allows the consolidation of the previous 9 datasets into
                a single dataset, bringing together all the data collected over
                the 2014-2021 timeframe.
                <br />
                The second intermediate dataset combines data on house price
                indices and the percentage of young people still living with
                their parents. This dataset was created as an indicator of
                economic independence and is necessary for conducting the final
                analysis presented in the last dataset mash-up.
              </p>
              <h6>Mash-up datasets.</h6>
              <p>
                The process of creation of the four different datasets is
                explained in the
                <a href="../datasets/intermediate_datasets.ipynb"

                  <b>I2 : Working status by age</b>

                  This dataset merges data related to the satisfaction of young
                  people at work and the gross hourly wage retribution. The goal
                  is trying to understand if there is a correlation between the
                  wage and the satisfaction at work, and if this could be a
                  parameter that could influence emigration to foreign
                  countries. It is necessary to notice that the age span
                  analyzed in D4 is 15-24 while D6 consideres an age bracket
                  15-29 years. Even though the two age spans do not coincide, we
                  still considered them as representative of young people, and
                  since no alignment of this data was possible, we chose to work
                  with these different age spans. Furthermore, D6 does not
                  contain data related to 2022, for this reason this mash-up
                  dataset takes into consideration only data from 2014 to 2021.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>I3 : Work wages across sectors</b>

                  This dataset aims at combining data related to the average
                  salary based on type of contract, age of the employees and
                  educational qualification. The final dataset takes in
                  consideration not only the temporal span, but also italian
                  geographical macroareas (North-west, North-east, Center and
                  South) and the economic activity. In all of the three starting
                  datasets only data related to 2014-2021 was available.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>I4 : Graduates' employment status</b>

                  This dataset focuses mainly on the graduates' working
                  conditions, in particular considering their level of
                  satisfaction at work, the employment rate and the average
                  wage. This analysis is quite general, since no geographical
                  subdivision nor economic activities are taken into
                  consideration. This is due to the fact that this information
                  was not present in D4 and D17. Moreover, the age span
                  considered in this analysis is not consistent:
                  <ul>
                    <li>D4 presents an age span of 15-24</li>
                    <li>
                      D17 consideres employment rate of graduates after 3 years
                      from graduation. No data about their age is present.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      D7 consideres only hourly wage by educational
                      qualification with no data related to age.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  Although we had considered eliminating the age range in D4,
                  removing this variable would have meant not paying proper
                  attention to young people. D4 does not provide any information
                  regarding an age group considered as "youth" different from
                  the one indicated, so the chosen age range has been retained.
                  D17 provides information related to the 3 years following the
                  completion of a master's degree. According to AlmaLaurea data,
                  on average, obtaining a master's degree occurs around the age
                  of 27, so the reference to these data would be relevant to 30
                  years old graduates. The hourly salary based on the level of
                  education is considered as the median, allowing for the
                  analysis of the central position relative to the ordered data
                  and is not sensitive to the presence of outliers. Even in this
                  case the temporal span considered for this analysis is
                  2014-2021 since D7 contained only data related to this time
                  span.

                  from Italy, indices of house prices and number of young people
                  still living at home with their parents from 2014 to 2022.

              <h4>Visualization</h4>
              <p>
                Data visualization is a key step in the process of turning raw
                data into information understandable to everyone. That is why we
                processed our main datasets resulting from the mash-up into
                visualization charts. During this process, we encountered some
                difficulties primarily given by the fact that within the same
                datasets there was data expressed in different measuraments
                units (percentages, units of people, euros). However, the
                problem was solved by making sure that the data did not mix in
                the visualization (for example, by referring to the same y
                axis). Out of four visualizations, three are charts that aim to
                show the evolution in time of a specific phenomenon. For the
                fourth visualization, we chose to show the differences by
                highlighting the role played by the geographical area on various
                phenomena.

              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>
                We've conducted thorough research on the status of young people
                in Italy in regards to their working conditions and
                satisfaction, in order to investigate the reasons that might be
                behind the high level of emigration in this country. Our
                approach involved gathering and analyzing data from various
                sources, such as Istat (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica) and
                AlmaLaurea. By combining and examining data from diverse
                origins, we aimed to gain an thorough understanding of this
                issue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our objective was to approach these data by stating an
                hypothesis on the issue. By comparing emigration data with
                metrics related to young people's employment rate, their
                work-satisfaction and their wages, we aim to uncover potential
                correlations and gain deeper insights into the impact of these
                factors on their choice to leave the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this comprehensive analysis, we strive to investigate
                well-known issues related to the economic independence and the
                satisfaction of young people in Italy, even though we are aware
                of the fact that most data related to these aspects are actually
                not trackable and therefore not available due to phenomena such
                as unreported employment.
