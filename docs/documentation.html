                  <h4>Introduction</h4>
                  <p>"Cervelli in Fuga" is a project on young Italian people and their choice of leaving their home country. Often discussed in the media, the problem of emigration in Italy has various factors that need to be taken into account in order to understand what really lies behind the big number of young people choosing to live and work abroad.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="item-1-1">
                  <h5>Scenario</h5>
                  <p>This project aims to investigate what might be the possible reasons behind many young people's choice of leaving Italy. Our hypothesis is that the difficulty in gaining a proper economic indipendence and the lack of meritocracy are the main aspects that bring young Italians to leave their home country. In order to consider this hypothesis on the level of data, we have considered 16 datasets related to graduate rate employment, house prices, hourly wage and work satisfaction. The time span taken into account for this analysis goes from 2014 to 2022, as our aim is to give a full picture of young Italians' working conditions in the most recent years. Of course, this project does not aim to draw any conclusions on the matter: in fact, data is not enough to tell the full story and the fact that these aspects might or might not be correlated does not imply that anything in terms of causality. Moreover, the team of this project selected the datasets on the basis of the hypothesis previously stated: therefore, the choice of the datasets is not scientifically grounded. Within the sphere of interest, datasets were selected on the basis of availability and compatibility with one another. All these factors considered, it is once again necessary to state that this project is the elaboration of an hypothesis and does not aim to make any type of statements. Further research is needed in order to assess a conclusion, and more datasets need to be taken into account to cross-check the results.</p>

                  <h5>Datasets</h5>
                  <h6>Sources of the original datasets:</h6>
                  <ul>
                  <li><b>ISTAT </b>is the primary source of statistics in Italy, regarding population, wages, environmental issues, social problems, all gathered through surveys and analyses. Here, focusing on young people and the reason why they emigrate, we decided to analyze quite a number of datasets coming from this source, exploring hourly wages, price of houses, percentage of young people still living with their parents, work satisfaction and percentage of young italians that have emigrated. </li>
                  <li><b>ALMALAUREA</b> is a consortium joined by 75 Italian universities and the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research, with the purpose or objectives of statistical studies related to the Italian university world. This source has been used to extract information about the rate of employed graduates in Italy. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The datasets obtained from Istat have already been filtered at the source, considering common and necessary variables to be displayed within the datasets. On the other hand, for datasets obtained from AlmaLaurea, it was not possible to filter the necessary data at the source, so it was necessary to download the entire CSV files, provided year by year. Subsequently, especially for the latter, a cleaning process was carried out to select only the necessary data and merge the data together.

                  <h5>Quality</h5>
                  <p>                 
                    The "National Guidelines for Enhancing Public Information
                    Heritage", in particular considering the section related to
                    <a
                      href="https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/bozza/aspettiorg.html#qualita-dei-dati"
                      >Data quality</a
                    >, underline four among other characteristics that are
                    necessary to point out when analyzing the goodness of data.
                    This step is necessary in order to guarantee the
                    "certification of the accuracy of the provided data and,
                    above all, its suitability for the intended use." These four characteristics are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Accuracy (syntactic and semantic) </li>
                        <li>Coherence</li>
                        <li>Completeness</li>
                        <li>Timeliness (or timeliness of updating)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div id="item-2-2">
                  <h5>Legal</h5>
                  <p>Before reasling datasets to the public, it is necessary to investigate the legal framework that allows or resctrits its publication.</p>
                  <p>The following check list is an instrument to verify the legal aspects connected to the publication of data. Basing ourselves on this checklsit, for each dataset we evaluated the following topics: privacy issues, IPR policy, licenses, limitations on public access, economical conditions, and temporal aspects of the dataset.</p>
                  <ul><li>Privacy: GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2018/1807, Directive 2002/58/EC;</li>
                    <li>Open data directive, PSI: Directive (EU) 2019/1024</li> <li>Copyright directive, CDSM: DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/790</li>
                    <li>INSPIRE: Directive 2007/2/EC that defines particular limitation on public access for spatial and geo data.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>We performed the legal analyis directly on the platforms that initially hosted the datasets, in order to have a full picture of the legal status of these data. Therefore, all datasets analysed are not owned by the creators of this project. However, the datasets used for the visualizations are a result of the mesh-up between different datasets and they are owned by "Cervelli in Fuga". Therefore, all datasets processed and created during the mesh-up phase are updated to January 2024. For complete and precise information, however, the user is invited to refer to the origianal datasets linked in the section related to the Quality Analysis.</p>

                  <h5>Technical</h5>
                    <h6>Format</h6>
                    <p>The data from Istat is made available in various versions for download, such as CSV, JSON, Excel, and SDMX-CSV. The latter is an open standard format as it has a formal specification (XML). The other formats are not open standards, but CSV, in particular, is a format used for the exchange of tabular data. Data from AlmaLaurea is available for download only in CSV format.</p>
                    <h6>Metadata</h6><p>
                    The "National Guidelines for Enhancing Public Information
                    Heritage", in particular considering the section related to
                    <a
                      href="https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/stabile/modellometadati.html"
                      >Metadata Model</a
                    >, highlight four distinct levels of metadata that progressively convey the degree of connection between data and metadata, along with the level of detail. <br>
                    The metadata from Istat has a dual description that places them at both level 4 and level 2. Level 2 represents a weak bond between data and metadata and it is represented by external metadata accessible from the SIqual portal (cases where this information can be accessed are reported in the "timeliness" section of the "quality analysis" table). Level 4 is represented by the data contained in SDMX format files that link metadata to each individual data point. This combination allows for metadata that is comprehensible both to humans and machines.

                    Datasets from AlmaLaurea do not include metadata, so they fall into level 1.</p>
                    <h6>Licenses</h6>
                    <p>
                      During the preliminary technical analysis, the licenses used within the original datasets and/or by the originating institutions were examined. Regarding ISTAT data, they are made available under the CC-BY-3.0 license, as indicated <a href="https://www.istat.it/it/note-legali">here</a>. This license allows for "reproduction, distribution, transmission, and adaptation of data and analyses from the National Institute of Statistics, even for commercial purposes, provided that the source is cited."
                      
                      <br>On the other hand, in the case of AlmaLaurea, there is no explicit reference to the type license used, with the only indication being "Unless otherwise indicated, reproduction for non-commercial purposes with citation of the source is authorized".</p>
                    <h6>FAIR principles</h6>
                    <p>During our process we analysed both our newly created datasets and metadata related using the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf">FAIR</a> principles.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><i><b>Findable</b><br>
                        The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.</i>
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier</li>
                          <li>F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)</li>
                          <li>F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe</li>
                          <li>F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li><i><b>Accessible</b><br>
                          Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.</i>
                          </li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol</li>
                            <li>A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable</li>
                            <li>A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary</li>
                            <li>A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available</li>
  
                          </ul>
                      <li><i><b>Interoperable</b><br>
                            The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.</i>
                            </li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.</li>
                              <li>I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles</li>
                              <li>I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><i><b>Reusable</b><br>
                              The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.</i>

                  <h4>Visualization</h4>
                  <p>Data visualization is a key step in the process of turning raw data into information understandable to everyone. That is why we processed our main datasets resulting from the mash-up into visualization charts. During this process, we encountered some difficulties primarily given by the fact that within the same datasets there was data expressed in different measuraments units (percentages, units of people, euros). However, the problem was solved by making sure that the data did not mix in the visualization (for example, by referring to the same y axis). Out of four visualizations, three are charts that aim to show the evolution in time of a specific phenomenon. For the fourth visualization, we chose to show the differences by highlighting the role played by the geographical area on various phenomena.</p>
