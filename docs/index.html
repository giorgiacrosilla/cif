          About the project
        </h2>
        <div class="containeranalysis">
        <p>
          The project stems from the necessity of visualizing the data related
          to young individuals choosing to leave the country of Italy. The aim
          is to identify possible correlations between the emigration rate and
          other factors such as the employment rate after graduation, the
          average of housing prices over the years and the satisfaction with
          one's working conditions.<br />Inspiration was taken by a report
          published on the
          <a
            href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/italy-is-stuck-in-a-european-brain-drain/"
            >European Data Journalism Network</a
          >
          by Giuseppe Chiellino (Il Sole 24 Ore) having title "Italy is stuck in
          a European brain drain". The report highlights the lack of third-level
          education, especially in the South of Italy, as well as the high
          emigration rate in the whole country. "Cervelli in Fuga"'s aim is to
          make an hypothesis on the hidden reasons behind the decision to leave
          that a lot of Italians make.

                                apply the “reasonable return of investment”?

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>

          <h3>I2: Working satisfaction per hourly wage</h3>
          <p>This visualisation showcases the relation between satisfaction of workers and their hourly wage.

          <p>This visualisation showcases on a map different variables: the percentages of young people still living at their parents' (in purple), the average house prices and the number of emigrated people. The map was chosen to highlight the differences between the different areas of Italy; however, the variable of time was taken into consideration in order to also show the changes over the years 2014-2022.
